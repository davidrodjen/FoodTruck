# FoodTruck
This website is a project oriented as a adaptive business in light of recent historical events.

# Catering Food Truck
**Purpose:** A catering food truck, that can either have orders placed for delivery, or ordered to a specific location for a higher price, to deliver on site immediate catering services to a group outdoors. Intent is for clean healthy eating, and rather than leaving the home to get food, food will come to you and your neighborhood. Website will display, relative location of current delivery as an alert letting current and previous clients know when they are in business nearby. 

Menu will always be available, unless an item is removed by the Admin for whatever reason. Current location will be displayed on the front page with a map. Client can log in and place orders for food, enter the delivery address or street corner, social distancing encouraged, truck will arrive, serve customers for catering but also take on-demand orders. Catering can be ordered specifically but walk-ups will still be able to place orders. This is when an alert will notify current and previous customers that the truck is available in the area.
